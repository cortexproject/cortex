New maintainers are proposed by an existing maintainer and are elected by [majority vote](./_index.md#changes-in-maintainership). Once the vote passed, the following steps should be done to add a new member to the maintainers team:

1. Submit a PR to add the new member to `MAINTAINERS`
2. Invite to [GitHub organization](https://github.com/orgs/cortexproject/people)
3. Invite to [`cortex-team` group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cortex-team)
4. Invite to [Quay.io repository](https://quay.io/organization/cortexproject?tab=teams)
5. Invite to [Docker Hub organization](https://hub.docker.com/u/cortexproject)
6. Invite to [CNCF `cncf-cortex-maintainers` mailing list](https://lists.cncf.io/g/cncf-cortex-maintainers) (via [CNCF Service Desk](https://servicedesk.cncf.io))
