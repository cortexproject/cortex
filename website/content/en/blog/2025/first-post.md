Welcome to the official Cortex blog!

Weâ€™re kicking things off here to share updates, best practices,
technical deep-dives, and community highlights around everything Cortex.
Whether you're operating a Cortex cluster, integrating it into your observability platform,
or just starting to explore scalable time-series databases â€” you're in the right place.

In the coming weeks, you can expect posts on:
- Real-world Cortex deployment strategies and lessons learned
- Tips for running Cortex efficiently at scale
- Deep dives into key Cortex concepts like blocks storage, ruler sharding, and query federation
- Guides to help new contributors get involved with the project
- Interviews with maintainers and users from across the community
- Roadmap insights and upcoming features we're excited about

Cortex has grown a lot thanks to a vibrant community of operators, contributors, and partners.
This blog will be another space for us to connect, learn from each other, and push the project even further.

Stay tuned â€” the first technical post is coming soon!

If there's a topic youâ€™d love to see covered, feel free to reach out or open a discussion in our [Cortex community forums](https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/discussions).

Thanks for being part of the journey! ðŸš€

â€” The Cortex Team
