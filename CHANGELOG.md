# Changelog

## master / unreleased

* [FEATURE] Fan out parallelizable queries to backend queriers concurrently.
  * `-querier.sum-shards` (bool)
  * Requires a shard-compatible schema (v10+)
  * This causes the number of traces to increase accordingly.
  * The query-frontend now requires a schema config to determine how/when to shard queries, either from a file or from flags (i.e. by the `config-yaml` CLI flag). This is the same schema config the queriers consume.
  * It's also advised to increase downstream concurrency controls as well:
    * `querier.max-outstanding-requests-per-tenant`
    * `querier.max-query-parallelism`
    * `querier.max-concurrent`
    * `server.grpc-max-concurrent-streams` (for both query-frontends and queriers)
* [BUGFIX] Fixed unnecessary CAS operations done by the HA tracker when the jitter is enabled. #1861

## 0.4.0 / 2019-12-02

* [CHANGE] The frontend component has been refactored to be easier to re-use. When upgrading the frontend, cache entries will be discarded and re-created with the new protobuf schema. #1734
* [CHANGE] Removed direct DB/API access from the ruler. `-ruler.configs.url` has been now deprecated. #1579
* [CHANGE] Removed `Delta` encoding. Any old chunks with `Delta` encoding cannot be read anymore. If `ingester.chunk-encoding` is set to `Delta` the ingester will fail to start. #1706
* [CHANGE] Setting `-ingester.max-transfer-retries` to 0 now disables hand-over when ingester is shutting down. Previously, zero meant infinite number of attempts. #1771
* [CHANGE] `dynamo` has been removed as a valid storage name to make it consistent for all components. `aws` and `aws-dynamo` remain as valid storage names.
* [CHANGE/FEATURE] The frontend split and cache intervals can now be configured using the respective flag `--querier.split-queries-by-interval` and `--frontend.cache-split-interval`.
  * If `--querier.split-queries-by-interval` is not provided request splitting is disabled by default.
  * __`--querier.split-queries-by-day` is still accepted for backward compatibility but has been deprecated. You should now use `--querier.split-queries-by-interval`. We recommend a to use a multiple of 24 hours.__
* [FEATURE] Global limit on the max series per user and metric #1760
  * `-ingester.max-global-series-per-user`
  * `-ingester.max-global-series-per-metric`
  * Requires `-distributor.replication-factor` and `-distributor.shard-by-all-labels` set for the ingesters too
* [FEATURE] Flush chunks with stale markers early with `ingester.max-stale-chunk-idle`. #1759
* [FEATURE] EXPERIMENTAL: Added new KV Store backend based on memberlist library. Components can gossip about tokens and ingester states, instead of using Consul or Etcd. #1721
* [FEATURE] EXPERIMENTAL: Use TSDB in the ingesters & flush blocks to S3/GCS ala Thanos. This will let us use an Object Store more efficiently and reduce costs. #1695
* [FEATURE] Allow Query Frontend to log slow queries with `frontend.log-queries-longer-than`. #1744
* [FEATURE] Add HTTP handler to trigger ingester flush & shutdown - used when running as a stateful set with the WAL enabled.  #1746
* [ENHANCEMENT] Reduce memory allocations in the write path. #1706
* [ENHANCEMENT] Consul client now follows recommended practices for blocking queries wrt returned Index value. #1708
* [ENHANCEMENT] Consul client can optionally rate-limit itself during Watch (used e.g. by ring watchers) and WatchPrefix (used by HA feature) operations. Rate limiting is disabled by default. New flags added: `--consul.watch-rate-limit`, and `--consul.watch-burst-size`. #1708
* [ENHANCEMENT] Added jitter to HA deduping heartbeats, configure using `distributor.ha-tracker.update-timeout-jitter-max` #1534
* [ENHANCEMENT] Add ability to flush chunks with stale markers early. #1759
* [BUGFIX] Stop reporting successful actions as 500 errors in KV store metrics. #1798
* [BUGFIX] Fix bug where duplicate labels can be returned through metadata APIs. #1790
* [BUGFIX] Fix reading of old, v3 chunk data. #1779
* [BUGFIX] Now support IAM roles in service accounts in AWS EKS. #1803

In this release we updated the following dependencies:
- gRPC v1.25.0  (resulted in a drop of 30% CPU usage when compression is on)
- jaeger-client v2.20.0
- aws-sdk-go to v1.25.22

## 0.3.0 / 2019-10-11

This release adds support for Redis as an alternative to Memcached, and also includes many optimisations which reduce CPU and memory usage.

* [CHANGE] Gauge metrics were renamed to drop the `_total` suffix.	#1685
  * In Alertmanager, `alertmanager_configs_total` is now `alertmanager_configs`
  * In Ruler, `scheduler_configs_total` is now `scheduler_configs`
  * `scheduler_groups_total` is now `scheduler_groups`.
* [CHANGE] `--alertmanager.configs.auto-slack-root` flag was dropped as auto Slack root is not supported anymore. #1597
* [CHANGE] In table-manager, default DynamoDB capacity was reduced from 3,000 units to 1,000 units. We recommend you do not run with the defaults: find out what figures are needed for your environment and set that via `-dynamodb.periodic-table.write-throughput` and `-dynamodb.chunk-table.write-throughput`.
* [FEATURE] Add Redis support for caching #1612
* [FEATURE] Allow spreading chunk writes across multiple S3 buckets	#1625
* [FEATURE] Added `/shutdown` endpoint for ingester to shutdown all operations of the ingester. #1746
* [ENHANCEMENT] Upgraded Prometheus to 2.12.0 and Alertmanager to 0.19.0. #1597
* [ENHANCEMENT] Cortex is now built with Go 1.13 #1675, #1676, #1679
* [ENHANCEMENT] Many optimisations, mostly impacting ingester and querier: #1574, #1624, #1638, #1644, #1649, #1654, #1702

## 0.2.0 / 2019-09-05

This release has several exciting features, the most notable of them being setting `-ingester.spread-flushes` to potentially reduce your storage space by upto 50%.

* [CHANGE] Flags changed due to changes upstream in Prometheus Alertmanager #929:
  * `alertmanager.mesh.listen-address` is now `cluster.listen-address`
  * `alertmanager.mesh.peer.host` and `alertmanager.mesh.peer.service` can be replaced by `cluster.peer`
  * `alertmanager.mesh.hardware-address`, `alertmanager.mesh.nickname`, `alertmanager.mesh.password`, and `alertmanager.mesh.peer.refresh-interval` all disappear.
* [CHANGE] --claim-on-rollout flag deprecated; feature is now always on #1566
* [CHANGE] Retention period must now be a multiple of periodic table duration #1564
* [CHANGE] The value for the name label for the chunks memcache in all `cortex_cache_` metrics is now `chunksmemcache` (before it was `memcache`) #1569
* [FEATURE] Makes the ingester flush each timeseries at a specific point in the max-chunk-age cycle with `-ingester.spread-flushes`. This means multiple replicas of a chunk are very likely to contain the same contents which cuts chunk storage space by up to 66%. #1578
* [FEATURE] Make minimum number of chunk samples configurable per user #1620
* [FEATURE] Honor HTTPS for custom S3 URLs #1603
* [FEATURE] You can now point the query-frontend at a normal Prometheus for parallelisation and caching #1441
* [FEATURE] You can now specify `http_config` on alert receivers #929
* [FEATURE] Add option to use jump hashing to load balance requests to memcached #1554
* [FEATURE] Add status page for HA tracker to distributors #1546
* [FEATURE] The distributor ring page is now easier to read with alternate rows grayed out #1621

## 0.1.0 / 2019-08-07

* [CHANGE] HA Tracker flags were renamed to provide more clarity #1465
  * `distributor.accept-ha-labels` is now `distributor.ha-tracker.enable`
  * `distributor.accept-ha-samples` is now `distributor.ha-tracker.enable-for-all-users`
  * `ha-tracker.replica` is now `distributor.ha-tracker.replica`
  * `ha-tracker.cluster` is now `distributor.ha-tracker.cluster`
* [FEATURE] You can specify "heap ballast" to reduce Go GC Churn #1489
* [BUGFIX] HA Tracker no longer always makes a request to Consul/Etcd when a request is not from the active replica #1516
* [BUGFIX] Queries are now correctly cancelled by the query-frontend #1508
