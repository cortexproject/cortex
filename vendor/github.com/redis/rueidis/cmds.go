// This allows users to store commands for later usage, for example:

//	c, release := client.Dedicate()
//	defer release()

//	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {

//	    panic(err)

// However, please know that once commands are processed by the Do() or DoMulti(), they are recycled and should not be reused.
