# Cortex Arguments Explained

## Distributor

- `-distributor.shard-by-all-labels`

   In the original Cortex design, samples were sharded amongst distributors by the combination of (userid, metric name).  Sharding by metric name was designed to reduce the number of ingesters you need to hit on the read path; the downside was that you could hotspot the write path.

   In hindsight, this seems like the wrong choice: we do many orders of magnitude more writes than reads, and ingester reads are in-memory and cheap. It seems the right thing to do is to use all the labels to shard, improving load balancing and support for very high cardinality metrics.

   Set this flag to `true` for the new behaviour.

   **Upgrade notes**: As this flag also makes all queries always read from all ingesters, the upgrade path is pretty trivial; just enable the flag. When you do enable it, you'll see a spike in the number of active series as the writes are "reshuffled" amongst the ingesters, but over the next stale period all the old series will be flushed, and you should end up with much better load balancing. With this flag enabled in the queriers, reads will always catch all the data from all ingesters.

- `-distributor.extra-query-delay`
   This is used by a component with an embedded distributor (Querier and Ruler) to control how long to wait until sending more than the minimum amount of queries needed for a successful response.

## Ingester, Distributor & Querier limits.

Cortex implements various limits on the requests it can process, in order to prevent a single tenant overwhelming the cluster.  There are various default global limits which apply to all tenants which can be set on the command line.  These limits can also be overridden on a per-tenant basis, using a configuration file.  Specify the filename for the override configuration file using the `-limits.per-user-override-config=<filename>` flag.  The override file will be re-read every 10 seconds by default - this can also be controlled using the `-limits.per-user-override-period=10s` flag.

The override file should be in YAML format and contain a single `overrides` field, which itself is a map of tenant ID (same values as passed in the `X-Scope-OrgID` header) to the various limits.  An example `overrides.yml` could look like:

```yaml
overrides:
  tenant1:
    ingestion_rate: 10000
    max_series_per_metric: 100000
    max_series_per_query: 100000
  tenant2:
    max_samples_per_query: 1000000
    max_series_per_metric: 100000
    max_series_per_query: 100000
```

When running Cortex on Kubernetes, store this file in a config map and mount it in each services' containers.  When changing the values there is no need to restart the services, unless otherwise specified.

Valid fields are (with their corresponding flags for default values):

- `ingestion_rate` / `-distributor.ingestion-rate-limit`
- `ingestion_burst_size` / `-distributor.ingestion-burst-size`

  The per-tenant rate limit (and burst size), in samples per second. Enforced on a per distributor basis, actual effective rate limit will be N times higher, where N is the number of distributor replicas.

  **NB** Changing these values currently require restarting the distributor.

- `max_label_name_length` / `-validation.max-length-label-name`
- `max_label_value_length` / `-validation.max-length-label-value`
- `max_label_names_per_series` / `-validation.max-label-names-per-series`

  Also enforced by the distributor, limits on the on length of labels and their values, and the total number of labels allowed per series.

- `reject_old_samples` / `-validation.reject-old-samples`
- `reject_old_samples_max_age` / `-validation.reject-old-samples.max-age`
- `creation_grace_period` / `-validation.create-grace-period`

  Also enforce by the distributor, limits on how far in the past (and future) timestamps that we accept can be.

- `max_series_per_user` / `-ingester.max-series-per-user`
- `max_series_per_metric` / `-ingester.max-series-per-metric`

  Enforced by the ingesters; limits the number of active series a user (or a given metric) can have.  When running with `-distributor.shard-by-all-labels=false` (the default), this limit will enforce the maximum number of series a metric can have 'globally', as all series for a single metric will be sent to the same replication set of ingesters.  This is not the case when running with `-distributor.shard-by-all-labels=true`, so the actual limit will be N/RF times higher, where N is number of ingester replicas and RF is configured replication factor.

  An active series is a series to which a sample has been written in the last `-ingester.max-chunk-idle` duration, which defaults to 5 minutes.

- `max_series_per_query` / `-ingester.max-series-per-query`
- `max_samples_per_query` / `-ingester.max-samples-per-query`

  Limits on the number of timeseries and samples returns by a single ingester during a query.
