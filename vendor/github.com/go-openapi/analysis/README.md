---

A foundational library to analyze an OAI specification document for easier reasoning about the content.


## Status

API is stable.

## Import this library in your project

```cmd
go get github.com/go-openapi/analysis
```

## What's inside?

* An analyzer providing methods to walk the functional content of a specification
* A spec flattener producing a self-contained document bundle, while preserving `$ref`s
* A spec merger ("mixin") to merge several spec documents into a primary spec
* A spec "fixer" ensuring that response descriptions are non empty

## FAQ

* Does this library support OpenAPI 3?
> No.
> This package currently only supports OpenAPI 2.0 (aka Swagger 2.0).
> There is no plan to make it evolve toward supporting OpenAPI 3.x.
> This [discussion thread](https://github.com/go-openapi/spec/issues/21) relates the full story.
