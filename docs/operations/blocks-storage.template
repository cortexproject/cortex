The blocks storage is an **experimental** Cortex storage engine based on [Prometheus TSDB](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/storage/): it stores each tenant's time series into their own TSDB which write out their series to a on-disk Block (defaults to 2h block range periods). Each Block is composed by chunk files - containing the timestamp-value pairs for multiple series - and an index, which indexes metric names and labels to time series in the chunk files.

The supported backends for the blocks storage are:

* [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3)
* [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/)
* [Microsoft Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/)
* [Local Filesystem](https://thanos.io/storage.md/#filesystem) (single node only)

_Internally, this storage engine is based on [Thanos](https://thanos.io), but no Thanos knowledge is required in order to run it._

The rest of the document assumes you have read the [Cortex architecture](../architecture.md) documentation.

## How it works

When the blocks storage is used, each **ingester** creates a per-tenant TSDB and ships the TSDB Blocks - which by default are cut every 2 hours - to the long-term storage.

**Queriers** periodically iterate over the storage bucket to discover recently uploaded Blocks and - for each Block - download a subset of the block index - called "index header" - which is kept in memory and used to provide fast lookups.

### The write path

**Ingesters** receive incoming samples from the distributors. Each push request belongs to a tenant, and the ingester append the received samples to the specific per-tenant TSDB. The received samples are both kept in-memory and written to a write-ahead log (WAL) stored on the local disk and used to recover the in-memory series in case the ingester abruptly terminates. The per-tenant TSDB is lazily created in each ingester upon the first push request is received for that tenant.

The in-memory samples are periodically flushed to disk - and the WAL truncated - when a new TSDB Block is cut, which by default occurs every 2 hours. Each new Block cut is then uploaded to the long-term storage and kept in the ingester for some more time, in order to give queriers enough time to discover the new Block from the storage and download its index header.

In order to effectively use the **WAL** and being able to recover the in-memory series upon ingester abruptly termination, the WAL needs to be stored to a persistent local disk which can survive in the event of an ingester failure (ie. AWS EBS volume or GCP persistent disk when running in the cloud). For example, if you're running the Cortex cluster in Kubernetes, you may use a StatefulSet with a persistent volume claim for the ingesters.

### The read path

**Queriers** - at startup - iterate over the entire storage bucket to discover all tenants Blocks and - for each of them - download the index header. During this initial synchronization phase, a querier is not ready to handle incoming queries yet and its `/ready` readiness probe endpoint will fail.

Queriers also periodically re-iterate over the storage bucket to discover newly uploaded Blocks (by the ingesters) and find out Blocks deleted in the meanwhile, as effect of an optional retention policy.

The blocks chunks and the entire index is never fully downloaded by the queriers. In the read path, a querier lookups the series label names and values using the in-memory index header and then download the required segments of the index and chunks for the matching series directly from the long-term storage using byte-range requests.

The index header is also stored to the local disk, in order to avoid to re-download it on subsequent restarts of a querier. For this reason, it's recommended - but not required - to run the querier with a persistent local disk. For example, if you're running the Cortex cluster in Kubernetes, you may use a StatefulSet with a persistent volume claim for the queriers.

### Series sharding and replication

The series sharding and replication doesn't change based on the storage engine, so the general overview provided by the "[Cortex architecture](../architecture.md)" documentation applies to the blocks storage as well.

It's important to note that - differently than the [chunks storage](../architecture.md#chunks-storage-default) - time series are effectively written N times to the long-term storage, where N is the replication factor (typically 3). This may lead to a storage utilization N times more than the chunks storage, but is actually mitigated by the [compactor](#compactor) service (see "vertical compaction").

### Compactor

The **compactor** is an optional - but highly recommended - service which compacts multiple Blocks of a given tenant into a single optimized larger Block. The compactor has two main benefits:

1. Vertically compact Blocks uploaded by all ingesters for the same time range
2. Horizontally compact Blocks with small time ranges into a single larger Block

The **vertical compaction** compacts all the Blocks of a tenant uploaded by any ingester for the same Block range period (defaults to 2 hours) into a single Block, de-duplicating samples that are originally written to N Blocks as effect of the replication.

The **horizontal compaction** triggers after the vertical compaction and compacts several Blocks belonging to adjacent small range periods (2 hours) into a single larger Block. Despite the total block chunks size doesn't change after this compaction, it may have a significative impact on the reduction of the index size and its index header kept in memory by queriers.

The compactor is **stateless**.

#### Compactor sharding

The compactor optionally supports sharding. When sharding is enabled, multiple compactor instances can coordinate to split the workload and shard blocks by tenant. All the blocks of a tenant are processed by a single compactor instance at any given time, but compaction for different tenants may simultaneously run on different compactor instances.

Whenever the pool of compactors increase or decrease (ie. following up a scale up/down), tenants are resharded across the available compactor instances without any manual intervention. Compactors coordinate via the Cortex [hash ring](../architecture.md#the-hash-ring).

#### Compactor HTTP endpoints

- `GET /compactor/ring`<br />
  Displays the status of the compactors ring, including the tokens owned by each compactor and an option to remove (forget) instances from the ring.

## Index cache

The querier and store-gateway support a cache to speed up postings and series lookups from TSDB blocks indexes. Two backends are supported:

- `inmemory`
- `memcached`

### In-memory index cache

The `inmemory` index cache is **enabled by default** and its max size can be configured through the flag `-experimental.tsdb.bucket-store.index-cache.inmemory.max-size-bytes` (or config file). The trade-off of using the in-memory index cache is:

- Pros: zero latency
- Cons: increased querier memory usage, not shared across multiple querier replicas

### Memcached index cache

The `memcached` index cache allows to use [Memcached](https://memcached.org/) as cache backend. This cache backend is configured using `-experimental.tsdb.bucket-store.index-cache.backend=memcached` and requires the Memcached server(s) addresses via `-experimental.tsdb.bucket-store.index-cache.memcached.addresses` (or config file). The addresses are resolved using the [DNS service provider](../configuration/arguments.md#dns-service-discovery).

The trade-off of using the Memcached index cache is:

- Pros: can scale beyond a single node memory (Memcached cluster), shared across multiple querier instances
- Cons: higher latency in the cache round trip compared to the in-memory one

The Memcached client uses a jump hash algorithm to shard cached entries across a cluster of Memcached servers. For this reason, you should make sure memcached servers are **not** behind any kind of load balancer and their address is configured so that servers are added/removed to the end of the list whenever a scale up/down occurs.

For example, if you're running Memcached in Kubernetes, you may:

1. Deploy your Memcached cluster using a [StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/)
2. Create an [headless service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#headless-services) for Memcached StatefulSet
3. Configure the Cortex's Memcached client address using the `dnssrvnoa+` [service discovery](../configuration/arguments.md#dns-service-discovery)

## Chunks cache

Store-gateway and querier also support cache for storing chunks fetched from storage. Chunks contain actual samples, and can be reused if user query hits the same series for the same time range.

To enable chunks cache, please set `-experimental.tsdb.bucket-store.chunks-cache.backend`. Chunks can currently only be stored into Memcached cache. Memcached client can be configured via flags with `-experimental.tsdb.bucket-store.chunks-cache.memcached` prefix.

There are additional low-level options for configuring chunks cache. Please refer to other flags with `experimental.tsdb.bucket-store.chunks-cache` prefix.

## Configuration

The general [configuration documentation](../configuration/_index.md) also applied to a Cortex cluster running the blocks storage, with few differences:

- [`storage_config`](#storage-config)
- [`tsdb_config`](#tsdb-config)
- [`store_gateway_config`](#store-gateway-config)
- [`compactor_config`](#compactor-config)

### `storage_config`

The `storage_config` configures the storage engine.

```yaml
storage:
  # The storage engine to use. Use "tsdb" for the blocks storage.
  # CLI flag: -store.engine
  engine: tsdb
```

{{ .TSDBConfigBlock }}

{{ .StoreGatewayConfigBlock }}

{{ .CompactorConfigBlock }}

## Known issues

### Can't ingest samples older than 1h compared to the latest received sample of a tenant

The blocks storage opens a TSDB for each tenant in each ingester receiving samples for that tenant. The received series are kept in the TSDB head (in-memory + Write Ahead Log) and then persisted to the storage whenever a new block is cut from the head.

A new block is cut from the head when the head (in-memory series) covers more than 1.5x of the block range period. For 2 hours block range (default), it means that the head needs to have 3h of data to cut a block. Block "start time" is always the minimum sample timestamp in the head, while block "end time" is aligned on block range boundary. The data stored into a block is then removed from the head. That means that after cutting the block, the head will already have at least 1h of data.

Given TSDB doesn't allow to append samples out of head bounds, the Cortex blocks storage can't ingest samples older than the minimum timestamp in the head or `(maximum timestamp - 1h)`, whatever is higher. Under normal conditions, the limit is about 1h before the latest received sample of a tenant.

The typical case where this issue triggers is after a long outage. Let's consider this scenario:

- Multiple Prometheus servers remote writing to the same Cortex tenant
- Some Prometheus servers stop remote writing to Cortex (ie. networking issue) and they fall behind more than 1h
- When the failing Prometheus servers will be back online, Cortex blocks storage will discard any sample whose timestamp is older than 1h because the max timestamp in the TSDB head is close to "now" (due to the working Prometheus servers which never stopped to write samples) while the failing ones are trying to catch up writing samples older than 1h

### Migrating from the chunks to the blocks storage

Currently, no smooth migration path is provided to migrate from chunks to blocks storage. For this reason, the blocks storage can only be enabled in new Cortex clusters.
