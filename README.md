# Open source, horizontally scalable Prometheus as a service

[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/weaveworks/cortex/tree/master.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/weaveworks/cortex/tree/master)

Cortex is a [Weaveworks](https://weave.works) project that forms the monitoring backend of [Weave Cloud](https://cloud.weave.works).

It provides horizontally scalable, long term storage for [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) metrics when used as a [remote write](https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/configuration/#remote_write) destination, and a horizontally scalable, Prometheus-compatible query API.

To use Cortex, sign up for [Weave Cloud](https://cloud.weave.works) and follow the instructions there.

Additional help can also be found in the [Weave Cloud documentation](https://www.weave.works/docs/cloud/latest/overview/):

* [Prometheus Monitoring in Weave Cloud](https://www.weave.works/docs/cloud/latest/concepts/prometheus-monitoring/)

## Developing

To build & test, install minikube, and run:

    eval $(minikube docker-env)
    make
    kubectl create -f ./k8s

Cortex will sit behind an nginx instance exposed on port 30080.  A job is deployed to scrape it itself.  Try it:

http://192.168.99.100:30080/api/prom/api/v1/query?query=up

### Experimental Bazel builds

We also have early support for Bazel builds.  Once you have [installed
bazel](https://bazel.build/versions/master/docs/install.html), try these commands:

    make bazel-test
    make bazel

This will require Bazel 0.5.4 or later.

Bazel can be useful for running fast, local, incremental builds and tests.
Currently [bazel does not support cross-compiling](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/issues/70)
so it is not used to produce the final binaries and docker container images.

### Vendoring

We use `dep` to vendor dependencies.  To fetch a new dependency, run:

    make update-vendor

To update dependencies, run

    dep ensure --update && make update-vendor
