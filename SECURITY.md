# Cortex Security and Disclosure Information

As with any complex system, it is certain that bugs will be found, some of them security-relevant. If you find a _security bug_ please report it privately to the maintainers listed in the MAINTAINERS of the relevant repository and CC cortex-team@googlegroups.com. We will fix the issue as soon as possible and coordinate a release date with you. You will be able to choose if you want public acknowledgement of your effort and if you want to be mentioned by name.

## Public Disclosure Timing

The public disclosure date is agreed between the Cortex Team and the bug submitter. We prefer to fully disclose the bug as soon as possible, but only after a mitigation or fix is available. We will ask for delay if the bug or the fix is not yet fully understood or the solution is not tested to our standards yet. While there is no fixed timeframe for fix & disclosure, we will try our best to be quick and do not expect to need the usual 90 days most companies ask or. For a vulnerability with a straightforward mitigation, we expect report date to disclosure date to be on the order of 7 days.

## Private Vendors List

We also have a list for vendors who provide Cortex to their users.
This list is not intended for individuals to find out about security issues.

### Embargo Policy

The information members receive on cortex-vendors-announce@googlegroups.com
must not be made public, shared, nor even hinted at anywhere
beyond the need-to-know within your specific team except with the list's
explicit approval. This holds true until the public disclosure date/time that was
agreed upon by the list. Members of the list and others may not use the information
 for anything other than getting the issue fixed for your respective vendorâ€™s users.

Before any information from the list is shared with respective members of your
team required to fix said issue, they must agree to the same terms and only
find out information on a need-to-know basis.

In the unfortunate event you share the information beyond what is allowed by
this policy, you _must_ urgently inform the cortex-team@googlegroups.com
mailing list of exactly what information
leaked and to whom. A retrospective will take place after the leak so
we can assess how to not make the same mistake in the future.

If you continue to leak information and break the policy outlined here, you
will be removed from the list.

### Contributing Back

This is a team effort. As a member of the list you must carry some water. This
could be in the form of the following:

**Technical**

- Review and/or test the proposed patches and point out potential issues with
  them (such as incomplete fixes for the originally reported issues, additional
  issues you might notice, and newly introduced bugs), and inform the list of the
  work done even if no issues were encountered.

**Administrative**

- Help draft emails to the public disclosure mailing list.
- Help with release notes.
